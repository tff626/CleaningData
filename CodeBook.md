* subject: IDs of volunteers taking part in the experiment, ranging 1 to 30.
* activity: measures obtained during a certain type of activity. 
         1 WALKING
         2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
         3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
         4 SITTING
         5 STANDING
         6 LAYING

* The remaining signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern, averaging out different trials:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
1. tBodyAcc-XYZ
2. tGravityAcc-XYZ
3. tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
4. tBodyGyro-XYZ
5. tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
6. tBodyAccMag
7. tGravityAccMag
8. tBodyAccJerkMag
9. tBodyGyroMag
10. tBodyGyroJerkMag
11. fBodyAcc-XYZ
12. fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
13. fBodyGyro-XYZ
14. fBodyAccMag
15. fBodyAccJerkMag
16. fBodyGyroMag
17. fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
