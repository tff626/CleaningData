* subject: IDs of volunteers taking part in the experiment, ranging 1 to 30.
* activity: measures obtained during a certain type of activity. 
         1 WALKING
         2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
         3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
         4 SITTING
         5 STANDING
         6 LAYING

* The remaining signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern, averaging out different trials:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
